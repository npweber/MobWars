Unlike most combat minigames in Minecraft, where PVP is almost always team  or individually based from a 1st-person perspective, in MobWars, two commanders control Squads of players that wage war between each other. It brings strategy into a PVP-based minigame, where there's more to the game than combat readiness.

MobWars takes players to a suitable random location in a server-generated world in a restricted bound of 200x200 - the battlefield. Squads are setup with iron gear and are moved by their respective commanders. Commanders can move their Squads into battle by putting them in close proximity of the enemy Squad(s). Once engaged, Squad members can freely initiate PVP against the enemy players without being confined to formation. Commanders can also retreat and heal their Squads, given that each Squad has an HP (health), and the commander has his/her own HP bank to replenish from. The war is waged until all opposing Squads have fallen. Inspired off of strategy games I've seen and played, MobWars is a true war in Minecraft PVP, developed as a Spigot plugin.
